    "description":"Ah the classic chocolate chunk. The quintessential cookie for dunking into a glass of cold milk. But this aint yo’ usual choco chunk cookie. We believe a good choc chunk has to have high quality chocolate and lots of it. So we only use big chunks of Whittaker’s chocolate & bake it so it’s crunchy on the outside but soft & chewy on the inside.",
